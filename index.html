        <p style="text-indent: 0;">Hello and welcome to my webpage. My name is Naail and on this page
        I will talk a little bit about myself and then talk about the design
        choices I used to determine the look of the page.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>

        <p style="text-indent:0;">Before we get into talking about design,
        here's a little bit about myself. My name is Naail and I was
        born in Pakistan and moved around<b> a lot </b>as a kid.
        Here's is a table of some of the places I've lived with some
        climatological data about them. All of the travelling inspired
        me to learn how to fly. I also included a picture of my views from
        training below.</p>

        <p>As an aviation geek, one of the things I enjoy doing is planespotting
        which is where you go to a nearby airport to watch planes. One website I
        often use while planespotting is
        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/"><strong>Flight Radar 24</strong></a>,
        which shows you a map of the planes flying in your area. I use it to
        look for where planes are headed to or where they're coming from as well
        as information about their speed and altitude. Another website I often
        use is <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/"><strong>Live ATC</strong></a>,
        which let's you listen to the radio conversations between pilots and air
        traffic controllers.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>

        <p style="text-indent:0;">Now that you know a little bit about me, let's get into talking
        about design! I designed this web page by using the the four basic
        principles of design outlined in the
        <strong>Non-Designer's Design Book</strong> by Robin Williams. The four
        basic principles of design are:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 17%; padding:0">
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Repetition</li>
            <li>Alignment</li>
            <li>Proximity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to learn more about the principles click and how I used
        them to style this page, click <a href="design.html"> here</a>!</p>
