        <p style="text-indent: 0;">This page is a WIP. However, please enjoy some old
        assignment contect about the principles of design.

        <p style="text-indent: 0;">Welcome to the page where I explain the four
        principles of design I used to style my homepage. From the
        <strong>Non-Designer's Design Book</strong> by Robin Williams,
        the basic principles are contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity.</p>

        <h3>Contrast</h3>

        <p style="text-indent: 0;">The idea of using contrast in the design of a
        a webpage is to make sure that if elements are unrelated, they should
        not look similar but they should look <strong>distinct</strong>.</p>

        <p>I used contrast in the design of my webpage by making a distinction
        between body text and headlines by use of different fonts. The body text
        uses a serif typeface while headlines use a strong bold typeface with a
        much larger font size. The three font sizes used on the page are 18px,
        23px, and 36px. Another element of contrast that I used in the design is
        contrasting the soft light green background with the bold black text of
        the headlines which helps to draw the eye to it. Additionally, the
        navigation bar at the top of the page is also black with the elements
        within it having a white text so that a bold contrast is created between
        the body of the page and the header. This attracts the readers eye and
        encourages them to click on the links to the other pages.</p>


        <h3>Repetition</h3>

        <p style="text-indent: 0;">Repetition is the idea that elements of the
        same family should have a similar design throughout the whole page.</p>

        <p>I used repetition in my page design by making sure that all headers
        and subheaders follow a consistent style of being the same sans-serif
        font in bold. All body text is the same serif font with the first
        paragraphs lacking an indent. This style is consistent on all pages of
        the site so that no matter which page the user is on, they know that it
        is part of my website. Another element that drives this point is the
        header which uses the same sans-serif font as the headers and appears
        the same on all pages</p>


        <h3>Alignment</h3>

        <p style="text-indent: 0;">The biggest rule in alignment is that nothing
        on the page should be arbitrarily placed. Each element should be aligned
        with something else. You should be able to draw a strong line between
        elements so that everything is <strong>unified</strong> and
        <strong>organized</strong></p>

        <p>I used this in my webpage design by creating a strong line on the
        left by having the paragraphs and all headers flush left on the page.
        The only elements that deviate from this are the bullet points along
        with the table and image. I did this to visually set them apart and
        catch the reader's eye. These elements are aligned further to the right
        of the body text and create a second left-edge for the eye of the
        reader to follow.</p>


        <h3>Proximity</h3>

        <p style="text-indent: 0;">Proximity is used in design to indicate how
        elements are related. Elements that are related to each other should be
        placed in close proximity so that the reader is able to establish a
        relationship between them. Unrelated items should be placed further
        away. The page should also have an obvious flow to it to guide the
        reader through the information</p>

        <p>I used proximity on my webpage by placing text close to their
        associated header so that the reader is easily able to navigate to
        the portion of the text they want to read by scanning the header.
        Additionally, the links to other pages of the site have been placed
        together at the top of the page so that the reader can easily flip
        between the pages. Hyperlinks to the sites have also been included in
        the write-up for ease of use.</p>
