        <p>Before, we get into talking about design,
        here's a little bit about myself. My name is Naail and I was
        born in Pakistan and moved around<b> a lot </b>as a kid.
        Here's is a table of some of the places I've lived with some
        climatological data about them.</p>

        <table border="1" align="center">
            <tr>
                <th colspan="4">Places I've Lived and their Climate</th>
            </tr>
            <tr align="center">
                <th>City</th>
                <th>Mean temp. (Â°C)</th>

        <p>Anyways, all this travelling inspired me to learn to fly.
        Here is a picture of the views I had during my training.</p>

        <p>As an aviation geek, one of the things I enjoy doing is
        planespotting which is where you go to a nearby airport to
        watch planes. One website I often use while planespotting is
        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flight Radar 24</a>,
        which shows you a map of the planes flying in your area. I use
        it to look for where planes are headed to or where they're
        coming from as well as information about their speed and altitude.
        Another website I often use is
        <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/">Live ATC</a>, which let's
        you listen to the radio conversations between pilots and
        air traffic controllers.</p>

        <p>Now that you know a little bit about me, let's get into talking
        about design! I designed this web page by using the the four basic
        principles of design outlined in A Non-Designer's Design Book by
        Robin Williams. The four basic principles of design are:
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Repetition</li>
            <li>Alignment</li>
            <li>Proximity</li>
        </ul>
        To learn more about the principles click and how I used them
        to style this page, click <a href="design.html"> here</a>!</p>
