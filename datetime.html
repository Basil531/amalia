        <h3>Difference from Standard</h3>
        <p>Amali time is different from the standard world clock where 0000h and 1200h refer to midnight
        and noon respectively. Amali time is shifted by six hours so that 0000h and 1200h refer to 
        sunrise and sunset respectively. Therefore noon and midnight take place at 0600h and 1800h.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>When the Amalian was sailing Westward, the sailors came across Swahili time during their stay in 
        East Africa. Here the Amalian sailors started to base their time on sunrise and sunset.</p>
        
        <p>Once more precise time keeping methods from celestial obervations became standard in Amalia, 0600h 
        became pinned to the sun crossing the southern meridian. This meant that sunrise and sunset would 
        vary by a few minutes from 0000h and 1200h throughout the year. This system is now called Amali 
        Traditional Time (ATT).</p>

        <p>After the creation of timezones, Amalians found themseleves on the border between UTC-6 and UTC-5. 
        Both of these options were not ideal since mean solar noon would be off my about thirty minutes form 
        both timezones. Following some lengthy debate in government, the lower house voted <!--insert vote %-->
        to follow UTC-5<!--insert reason-->.</p>

        <p>Despite the adoption of UTC-5 as the official timezone, locals continued to use a variation of ATT 
        in their day to day lives. Amali Standard Time (AST) runs six hours behind that of UTC-5 so that noon 
        coincides with the correct hour on the clock as with local tradition. However since the minutes are 
        synced to UTC-5, mean solar noon still occurs about thirty minutes later to tradtion. Therefore locals
        can simply convert between AST and UTC-5 by adding or subtracting 6 hours.
