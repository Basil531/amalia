        <p>As an aviation geek, one of the things I enjoy doing is planespotting
        which is where you go to a nearby airport to watch planes. One website I
        often use while planespotting is
        <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/"><strong>Flight Radar 24</strong></a>,
        which shows you a map of the planes flying in your area. I use it to
        look for where planes are headed to or where they're coming from as well
        as information about their speed and altitude. Another website I often
        use is <a href="https://www.liveatc.net/"><strong>Live ATC</strong></a>,
        which let's you listen to the radio conversations between pilots and air
        traffic controllers.</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>

        <p style="text-indent:0;">Now that you know a little bit about me, let's get into talking
        about design! I designed this web page by using the the four basic
        principles of design outlined in the
        <strong>Non-Designer's Design Book</strong> by Robin Williams. The four
        basic principles of design are:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 17%; padding:0">
            <li>Contrast</li>
            <li>Repetition</li>
            <li>Alignment</li>
            <li>Proximity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to learn more about the principles click and how I used
        them to style this page, click <a href="design.html"> here</a>!</p>
